Subject: [PATCH 014/352] futex,rt_mutex: Restructure
 rt_mutex_finish_proxy_lock()

Upstream commit 38d589f2fd08f1296aea3ce62bebd185125c6d81

With the ultimate goal of keeping rt_mutex wait_list and futex_q waiters
consistent it's necessary to split 'rt_mutex_futex_lock()' into finer
parts, such that only the actual blocking can be done without hb->lock
held.

Split split_mutex_finish_proxy_lock() into two parts, one that does the
blocking and one that does remove_waiter() when the lock acquire failed.

When the rtmutex was acquired successfully the waiter can be removed in the
acquisiton path safely, since there is no concurrency on the lock owner.

This means that, except for futex_lock_pi(), all wait_list modifications
are done with both hb->lock and wait_lock held.

[bigeasy@linutronix.de: fix for futex_requeue_pi_signal_restart]
