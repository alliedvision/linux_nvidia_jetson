## Overview

The scripts in this project build and install the Allied Vision MIPI camera driver to the NVIDIA Jetson boards.

Compatible platforms with JetPack 5.1 (L4T 35.2.1) : 

  - AGX Orin Developer Kit
  - AGX Xavier DevKit
  - Xavier NX DevKit
  - Auvidea carrier JNX30-PD with Xavier NX 

***Before starting the installation, make sure to create a backup of your Jetson system.***

## Prerequisites

### Host PC
The scripts for the driver installation require Git on the host PC.

### Install JetPack 5.1

## Install Alvium MIPI driver

### Method A: Use precompiled binaries   
 
  Install the precompiled kernel, which includes the driver and an installation menu.   

  1. Extract the tarball on a host PC.   
  The tarball contains helper scripts and another tarball with the precompiled binaries named AlliedVision_NVidia_L4T_35.2.1.0_<git-rev>.tar.gz. 

2. Copy the tarball to the target board. 
3. On the target board, extract the tarball and run the included install script.   
4. Proceed with selecting options from the installation menu as described below.

### Method B: Cross-compile binaries from source      
  The scripts require a host PC with Ubuntu (we recommend version 20.04).

Download sources and scripts from https://github.com/alliedvision/linux_nvidia_jetson to the host PC.

**On the host PC:**

1. Execute `./build.py -b xavier`  
Optionally you can sign the resulting apt repository with a pgp key by adding the option `--sign <name of pgp key>`.

2. Copy the tarball to the target board. 

**On the target board:**

Extract the tarball and run the included install script. 
The script includes an **installation menu**, please use the option for your hardware: 

+ Option `none`: The Allied Vision camera driver is not loaded during bootup. To load the driver, reboot the board.

+ For Xavier NX on JNX30, select option `Auvidea JNX30`.   
For all other supported modules on Jetson DevKit, select option `2 cameras`.  

Reboot the board. Now you can use the driver. 

To change the configuration after the driver was installed, enter:

`dpkg-reconfigure avt-nvidia-l4t-bootloader`

Reboot the board to apply the changes.
